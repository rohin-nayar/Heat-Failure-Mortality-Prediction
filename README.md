# Heart Failure Mortality Prediction

## Introduction

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the primary cause of global mortality, with heart failure being a significant contributor. This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict mortality risk associated with heart failure, using an open-source dataset containing 12 relevant features.

## Objective & Approach

By analyzing various physiological and demographic factors, the model seeks to provide early detection and management strategies for individuals at risk. Thorough data exploration and the application of various machine learning algorithms will be undertaken to develop an accurate predictive model.

## Dataset & Implementation

The dataset contains 12 features pertinent to predicting mortality by heart failure. The data will be preprocessed carefully, and machine learning algorithms will be applied to discern mortality risk effectively.

## Conclusion

This project aims to improve cardiovascular disease management by offering early detection and personalized intervention strategies. By providing actionable insights, the goal is to enhance health outcomes and quality of life for individuals at risk of heart failure mortality.
